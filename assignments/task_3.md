## Cairo Assignment 1

## Objective

This assignment aims to help students understand basic arithmetic operations and logical conditions in Cairo covering the primitive data types. Each function should be modular, reusable, and well-commented.

## Tasks
Implement the following:
### 1. Arithmetic Operations
   - **Subtraction:** performs subtraction of two numbers.
   - **Multiplication:** performs multiplication of two numbers.
   - **Division:** performs division of two numbers (ensure handling of division by zero).

### 2. Even or Odd Sum
   - Implement a function that takes two arguments, computes their sum, and determines whether the sum is even or odd.

### 3. Odd Number Checker
   - Implement a function that checks if a given number is odd.

### 4. Basic Logic Functions
   - **Number Sign Checker:** Implement a function to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - **Maximum of Two Numbers:** Implement a function to return the maximum of two numbers.


## Guidelines
- Each function should be modular and well-commented.
- Use meaningful variable names and snake_casing
- Ensure type safety by specifying argument and return types correctly.
- Handle edge cases such as division by zero.
- Test your functions within the `main` function before submission such that it logs the appropriate `stdout` on the terminal
