# Starknet Smart Contract Interaction Assignment
### Objective
In this assignment, you will interact with a deployed Starknet `Counter` contract using the Starkscan block explorer to directly call the contractâ€™s read and write functions.

### [Counter Contract Link](https://sepolia.starkscan.co/contract/0x0070c4689c7c2357a75efb62cadf39ebc0b076c7ac7261d577312ae9fe8a4ac2#read-write-contract)


### Tasks
- Explore the `Counter` contract

- Open the contract on Starkscan and review the available functions.

- Identify the functions for increasing, decreasing, and fetching the count.

- Perform the following actions via Starkscan

    - Increase count: execute `increase_count` function to increase the count by a custom amount argument

    - Increase count by one: execute `increase_count_by_one` function to increment the count by exactly one.

    - Decrease count: call `decrease_count` function to decrease count by a custom amount argument

    - Decrease count by one: call `decrease_by_count_one` function to decrement the count by exactly 1.

    - Get current Count: read the current count value from the contract by calling `get_count` 

- Document Your Actions
    - Copy the transaction hashes for the write operations.
    - Explain the process followed, including any challenges faced


### Bonus Task (Optional)
- Document the issues encountered while calling all functions with arguments
